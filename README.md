# Floppy Bird üê¶

--- 

Hello to whoever is reading (If there is anyone who even reads these)
Thanks for checking out my game!

This is my first Unity Project and is recreation of the original game - Flappy Bird, all assets used are my own personal drawn images (apart from the clouds since I couldn't draw them great.)

---

## Instructions
To run the game just download all the files within <> Code and run the floppybird.exe to start playing.
* Just use space bar to move bird up and down - otherwise just time your movement!

I hope you enjoy the game even though its pretty much the same as the original Flappy Bird game.
